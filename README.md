# codsoft_task4
This project involves designing a rock-paper-scissors game in Python.The program will prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will generate a random choice.Game logic will determine the winner:rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.The user's and computer's choices will be displayed, along with the result(win,lose,or tie).The program will track scores for multiple rounds and ask the user if they want to play another round.The focus is on designing a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.
